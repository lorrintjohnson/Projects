# Incident Investigation and Response Project

## Overview
In this project, I analyzed a suspicious file using VirusTotal and captured details about its related indicators of compromise (IoCs) using the Pyramid of Pain.

## Scenario
As a level one SOC analyst at a financial services company, I received an alert about a suspicious file downloaded on an employee's computer. The investigation revealed that the file was malicious, and I documented the findings using VirusTotal.

## Steps Taken
1. Reviewed the alert details.
2. Entered the file hash into VirusTotal.
3. Analyzed the VirusTotal report.
4. Documented IoCs using the Pyramid of Pain template.

## Conclusion
The file was determined to be malicious based on high detection rates, extensive network activity, and significant behavioral indicators.
