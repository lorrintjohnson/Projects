# Cybersecurity Risk Management Case Study

## Overview
This project involves developing a comprehensive cybersecurity control framework that encompasses asset identification and threat assessment, prioritization, and control baselines. The goal is to establish an effective control infrastructure that supports the business goals of the organization by protecting its assets against various threats.

## Scenario
You are a security analyst at a financial services company. Your task is to develop a robust cybersecurity control framework that includes identifying and assessing threats to organizational assets, prioritizing these assets based on risk, and deploying appropriate control measures. This framework will help ensure the protection of sensitive information and maintain the integrity of business operations.

## Project Steps

### 1. Asset Identification and Threat Assessment
- **Objective**: Compile a comprehensive list of organizational assets, determine the level of threat for each asset, and identify constraints on protection.
- **Steps**:
  1. **List Organizational Assets**: Identify assets such as employee information, customer information, operational processes, policies and standards, application assets, data storage, and hardware devices.
  2. **Identify Potential Threats**: Focus on human factors, including insider threats (intentional and unintentional) and external threats (moles).
  3. **Prepare a Threat Model**: Conduct regular risk assessments, provide security awareness training, manage accounts and privileges, perform penetration testing, and implement continuous monitoring.
- **Outcome**: A detailed inventory of assets and threats, along with a threat model that assigns criticality scores to each threat.

### 2. Prioritization
- **Objective**: Define the scope of control deployment and prioritize assets based on risk analysis.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Decide on Assets to Protect**: Based on the risk analysis, determine which assets need protection.
  2. **Create a Prioritized List**: Categorize assets into "must protect," "should protect," and "would like to protect" based on their criticality.
  3. **Design Defense-in-Depth Control Structure**: Implement multiple layers of security controls to ensure comprehensive protection.
- **Outcome**: A prioritized list of assets and a defense-in-depth control structure tailored to the organization's needs.

### 3. Control Baselines
- **Objective**: Develop and deploy a formal control baseline that includes management, operational, and technical controls.
- **Steps**:
  1. **Decide on Protection Types**: Determine the required protection types for each asset based on their priority.
  2. **Design Control Behaviors**: Develop specific control behaviors for each asset, including methods of validation.
  3. **Deploy Control Baseline**: Implement the control baseline using the COBIT Framework, ensuring that management, operational, and technical controls are in place.
- **Outcome**: A formal control baseline that provides a structured approach to managing and protecting organizational assets.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the development of a comprehensive cybersecurity control framework that includes asset identification and threat assessment, prioritization, and control baselines. By following these steps, the organization can effectively protect its assets, manage risks, and ensure the integrity of its operations.
