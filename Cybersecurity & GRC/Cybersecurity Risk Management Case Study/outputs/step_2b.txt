Personnel security involves a formal set of policies and procedures to assure the actions of the employees within the organization; this includes explicit responsibilities for security and their resulting accountabilities. Both responsibilities and accountabilities must be specified to prepare everyone for the next steps in the process. There are two factors that make personnel security hard to implement. The first is the training and follow-up of specific knowledge and skills of the employees who are responsible for executing the assurance functions. The second is the willingness of those employees to perform their assigned duties in a systematic and disciplined way. The overall success of the information assurance function depends on the organization’s ability to guarantee a minimum level of competency and commitment to security among its employees.

What makes personnel security so essential is that the overall success of the information assurance function depends on the organization’s ability to guarantee a minimum level of competency and commitment to security among its employees. The personnel security policy is based on comprehensive risk identification and threat prioritization which is aimed at identifying all the relevant security issues that might affect the employees. Personnel security ensures proper personnel behavior by establishing a perimeter, identifying threats, ensuring continuous practice, documenting security incidents, assigning the correct individuals with the correct responsibilities, and assuring critical systems.
