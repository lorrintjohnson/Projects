Ways to protect against insider threats include conducting regular risk assessments to understand the potential impact of insider attacks, providing regular security awareness training for all staff, closely managing the accounts and privileges of all employees and contractors, performing penetration testing at least annually to help identify security improvements, commission a simulated phishing assessment, and implementing a 24/7 network and endpoint monitoring to detect anomalous behavior.
