The chart below lists several relevant information assets that might be identified in this case. As for the reasoning for prioritizing each asset, the most valuable of the assets was ranked 1 and the least, of the items in this list, was ranked 3. Employee and customer information are definitely a top priority in any organization because compromising any of the systems that store and provide access to that information would result in not just loss of data and a potential risk to business operations, but also leave the business open for legal disputes with anyone whoâ€™s suffered damages. Policies and standards are of top priority as well because these are the baseline stand work instructions, procedures, and regulator compliance standards that the organization is based upon. If violated, it could ruin the entire structure of the company. The second priority items are operational processes and application assets. It is not to say that these items are not of high priority, but attacks at these surfaces result in fewer consequences than the assets in the first priority. Issues in these areas could potentially result in any loss of resources, interruptions in business operations, and/or legal issues. The third priority items are only third because they are usually assets that come into fruition near the end of a resins program. Proper data storage and protein of hardware devices inside a company will provide safer work environments and prevent loss of data through poor storage and any potential cyber-attacks using user devices.
