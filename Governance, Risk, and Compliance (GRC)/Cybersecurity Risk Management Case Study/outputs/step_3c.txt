The COBIT Framework is intended to support the leaders with this responsibility and assumes that in order to achieve its objectives, IT resources must be managed by a set of naturally grouped processes. The COBIT Framework contains 34 high-level control objectives that can be used as a guide to creating an adequate and comprehensive control system.
